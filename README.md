## A tour of the C# language

The first lessons explain C# concepts using small snippets of code.
You'll learn the basics of C# syntax and how to work with data types like strings, numbers, and booleans.
It's all interactive, and you'll be writing and running code within minutes.
These first lessons assume no prior knowledge of programming or the C# language.

You can try these tutorials in different environments. The concepts you'll learn are the same. The difference is which experience you prefer:

In your browser, on the docs platform: This experience embeds a runnable C# code window in docs pages. You write and execute C# code in the browser.
In the Microsoft Learn experience. This learning path contains several modules that teach the basics of C#.
In Jupyter on Binder. You can experiment with C# code in a Jupyter notebook on binder.
On your local machine. After you've explored online, you can download the .NET SDK and build programs on your machine.
All the introductory tutorials following the Hello World lesson are available using the online browser experience or in your own local development environment. 
At the end of each tutorial, you decide if you want to continue with the next lesson online or on your own machine. 
There are links to help you set up your environment and continue with the next tutorial on your machine.

C# (pronounced "See Sharp") is a modern, object-oriented, and type-safe programming language. 
C# enables developers to build many types of secure and robust applications that run in .NET.
C# has its roots in the C family of languages and will be immediately familiar to C, C++, Java, and JavaScript programmers.
This tour provides an overview of the major components of the language in C# 8 and earlier.
If you want to explore the language through interactive examples, try the introduction to C# tutorials.

C# is an object-oriented, component-oriented programming language. 
C# provides language constructs to directly support these concepts, making C# a natural language in which to create and use software components. 
Since its origin, C# has added features to support new workloads and emerging software design practices.
At its core, C# is an object-oriented language. You define types and their behavior.

Several C# features help create robust and durable applications.
Garbage collection automatically reclaims memory occupied by unreachable unused objects. 
Nullable types guard against variables that don't refer to allocated objects. 
Exception handling provides a structured and extensible approach to error detection and recovery. 
Lambda expressions support functional programming techniques.
Language Integrated Query (LINQ) syntax creates a common pattern for working with data from any source.
Language support for asynchronous operations provides syntax for building distributed systems.
C# has a unified type system. All C# types, including primitive types such as int and double, inherit from a single root object type.
All types share a set of common operations. Values of any type can be stored, transported, and operated upon in a consistent manner. 
Furthermore, C# supports both user-defined reference types and value types.
C# allows dynamic allocation of objects and in-line storage of lightweight structures.
C# supports generic methods and types, which provide increased type safety and performance. 
C# provides iterators, which enable implementers of collection classes to define custom behaviors for client code.

C# emphasizes versioning to ensure programs and libraries can evolve over time in a compatible manner.
Aspects of C#'s design that were directly influenced by versioning considerations include the separate virtual and override modifiers, 
the rules for method overload resolution, and support for explicit interface member declarations.
